For example, a clinician might prescribe two drugs in a row; each prescription action would be assigned a unique `hookInstance`. This allows a CDS Service to uniquely identify each hook invocation.
            Note: the `hookInstance` is globally unique and should contain enough entropy to be un-guessable."
